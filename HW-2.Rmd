## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Trisha, Bianca
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW so far:7 hours
* The URL of the RPubs published URL [here](http://rpubs.com/connormccormick/hw2).
* What gave you the most trouble:Conditional Probabilities
* Any comments you have: I could not figure out how to add a median line or how to change the color of the graphs that are have fill=sex.



## Question 1:

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `profiles` data set,
specifically on the relationship between gender and

* `income`
* `job`
* `petowners`
all keeping in mind in HW-3, you will be fitting a logistic regression to
predict a user's gender based on these variables.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}

profiles <- profiles %>%
  mutate(is_female = ifelse(sex=="f", 1, 0))


gender <- profiles %>%
  mutate(sex = fct_recode(sex, "Female" = "f", "Male" = "m")) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  tally()%>%
  rename(gender = n) %>%
  mutate(prop = gender/sum(gender))

## Question 2:

In the file `HW-2_Shiny_App.Rmd`, build the Shiny App discussed in Lec09 on
Monday 10/3: Using the `movies` data set in the `ggplot2movies` data set, make a
Shiny app that

* Plots budget on the x-axis and rating on the y-axis
* Instead of having a radio button to select the genre of movie (`Action`,
`Animation`, `Comedy`, etc), have a radio button that allows you to toggle
between comedies and non-comedies. This app should be simpler.
